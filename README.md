# WordPad TODO clean up

> wordpad_orig is from https://github.com/malxau/wordpad
This repo is an attempt to maintain the WordPad source code and keep it useful and relevant.
The WordPad source code has been included as a sample in compilers since 1995 under restrictive terms.  These samples are now available under the MIT license, including the version bundled with Visual C++ 2008 and 2010.  This source is a fork of the [most recent code from the 2010 compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2010Samples/MFC/ole/wordpad).

> This is a modern version for Win11 24H2 and beyond (since it was removed). Build it in VS 2022+ with the C++ (with MFC) workload.

> Beyond the original notes I did:
- remove reg editing
- mfc static
- remove 32bit x64 only, add amd?
??? Add MIT license to compiled binaries, which is required by the license

This code is available under the same license as the sample code, MIT + All rights reserved.
